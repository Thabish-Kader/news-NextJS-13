### Lesson Learnt

As i was building this application i realized that next 13 forces the developer to code in a way that forces them to comparmantalize their code. What i mean by this is that in order to seperate the server and client components the programmer must further break down components into sub components (which is really good).

### Problems

-   While implementing the api portion of the build i was getting error. After 2 hours of checking and rechecking i found that it was because i had spelt business wrong. This led to requesting to the wrong api.

-   While implementing dark mode i got an error for hydration. Upon closer inspection on docs i ound the solution [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes#avoid-hydration-mismatch)
