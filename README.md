### Problems

-   While implementing the api portion of the build i was getting error. After 2 hours of checking and rechecking i found that it was because i had spelt business wrong. This led to requesting to the wrong api.

-   While implementing dark mode i got an error for hydration. Upon closer inspection on docs i ound the solution [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes#avoid-hydration-mismatch)
